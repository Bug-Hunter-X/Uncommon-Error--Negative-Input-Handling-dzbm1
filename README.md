This repository demonstrates a common yet easily overlooked error in MATLAB: improper handling of negative inputs. The `bug.m` file contains a function that throws an error when a negative number is provided as input. The `bugSolution.m` file shows how to correctly handle negative inputs, either by returning an appropriate value or gracefully exiting with an informative message.
